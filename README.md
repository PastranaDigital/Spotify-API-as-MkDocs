# Spotify API as MkDocs

This project is to convert the existing SPotify Web API documentation into MkDocs. During this effort I plan to better understand the abilities and limitations of MkDocs and its plug-ins.
 
Where it began: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api

My conversion: https://pastranadigital.github.io/Spotify-API-as-MkDocs/
